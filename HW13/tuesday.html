<h1> Tuesday </h1>
<p> On Tuesday, I woke up at 5:30 in the morning and went to the 360 Bridge with my pledge team and pledge class </p>
<p> Then, I took graduation photos with my friend Evelyn. We were taking pictures from 8:45am to 12:30pm.</p>
<p> After that, I ate lunch and then went to my 2pm class </p>
